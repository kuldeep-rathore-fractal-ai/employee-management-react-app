## Follow the codding style from react official documentation and use functional components with hooks. Avoid using class components unless necessary for specific use cases. Ensure that all components are properly typed with TypeScript and follow best practices for state management and component composition.

## always suggest fist arrow fucntions over traditional function declarations for defining components and functions. This promotes a more modern and concise coding style, enhancing readability and maintainability of the codebase.


## Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and components. For example, use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for component names. This helps improve code readability and maintainability.

## When working with API calls, use async/await syntax for better readability and error handling. Ensure that all API interactions are properly typed and handle potential errors gracefully to enhance the user experience.

## For styling, utilize Bootstrap React components and classes to maintain a consistent and responsive design throughout the application. Avoid custom CSS unless necessary, and ensure that any custom styles are well-organized and documented.

## Pages allwasy follow the responsive design principles to ensure that the application works well on various screen sizes and devices. Use Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities to achieve this.
