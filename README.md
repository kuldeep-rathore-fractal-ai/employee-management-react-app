# Capstone Project: Employee Management System

This project is a full-stack assignment to demonstrate CRUD operations for an Employee Management System. The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, styled using Bootstrap React, and communicates with a Node.js backend API. The goal is to provide a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface for managing employee records.

- Responsive UI with Bootstrap React
- Integration with Node.js backend API

---

## Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Bootstrap React
- Node.js (Backend API)

## Backend API
This project uses the [employee-management-api](http://localhost:3000) Node.js backend for API calls. Make sure the backend server is running on port **3000** before starting the frontend application.

**Backend URL:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
